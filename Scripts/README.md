# 2_Scripts

Core scripts for preprocessing, modeling, fusion, dimensionality reduction, and XAI.

## Subfolders
- `Preprocessing/`: EEG/fMRI cleaning, filtering, synchronization.
- `DimensionalityReduction/`: Nonlinear techniques (e.g., UMAP, t-SNE).
- `FeatureEngineering/`: Extraction of temporal, spectral, and connectivity features.
- `AttractorModeling/`: Cross-attractor dynamics, CATE-NET structure.
- `Fusion/`: ICA-based fusion, EEG-informed fMRI methods.
- `XAI_Interpretability/`: LRP and relevance map generation.

Each folder contains runnable modules with proper documentation.
