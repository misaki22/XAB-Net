# 3_Models

Stores all trained models and configuration files.

## Subfolders
- `TrainedModels/`: Final trained weights (e.g., cate_net_final.pt).
- `Checkpoints/`: Intermediate model snapshots from training epochs.
- `Configs/`: YAML/JSON configuration files for reproducibility.

## Notes
Model architecture follows attractor dynamics with integrated interpretability (XAI).
